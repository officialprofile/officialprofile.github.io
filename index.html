	   					<h4>Comparison of DWI kurtosis and standard mono-exponential ADC in diagnosis of significant prostate cancer – a correlation with whole mount histopathology specimens</h4>
	   					<p>To compare the diagnostic performance of DKI with the standard monoexponential ADC model in the detection of significant prostate cancer, using whole-mount histopathology of radical prostatectomy specimens as a reference standard. 155 patients with prostate cancer had undergone mpMRI at 3T before prostatectomy, including DWI imaging. D and kurtosis maps were generated using the kurtosis model and ADC maps with b values up to 1200 and 2000 s/mm2 using the standard monoexponential model. Quantitative diffusion parameters were correlated with Gleason Score, compared between cancerous and benign tissue and between GS≤3+3 and GS≥3+4 tumors. The mean values of all diffusion parameters were significantly different both between malignant and benign tissue and between GS≤3+3 and GS≥3+4 tumors. Although the kurtosis model was better fitted to DWI data, the diagnostic performance in ROC analysis of DKI and standard ADC model in the detection of significant PCa was similar.</p>

	   					<h4>Convolutional Neural Networks for C. Elegans Muscle Age Classification Using Only 
Self-Learned Features</h4>
	   					<p>Nematodes <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> (<i>C. elegans</i>) have been used as model organisms in a wide variety of biological studies, especially oriented towards better understanding aging and age-associated diseases. This paper concerns the automation of <i>C. elegans</i> imagery analysis to classify the muscle age of nematodes based on the known and well established IICBU dataset. Unlike many modern classification methods, the proposed approach utilizes Deep Learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to solve the problem and achieve high classification accuracy by focusing on non-handcrafted self-learned features. Various networks known from ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) were investigated and adapted for the <i>C. elegans</i> muscle aging dataset via transfer learning and data augmentation techniques. The proposed approach of unfreezing different numbers of convolutional layers in the feature extraction stage, and introducing different structures of newly trained fully connected layers in the classification stage, allowed for better fine-tuning of the selected networks. Adjusted CNNs featured in this paper have been compared with other state-of-art methods. In antiaging drug research, the proposed CNN would be a very fast and effective age determination method, which would lead to reductions in time and costs of laboratory research.</p>

	   					<h4>The Role of the Trabecular Bone Score in the Assessment of Osteoarticular Disorders in Patients with HFE-Hemochromatosis: A Single-Center Study from Poland</h4>
	   					<p>Type 1 hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is an autosomal, recessive genetic entity with systemic iron overload. Iron homeostasis disorders develop as a result of HFE gene mutations, which are associated with hepcidin arthropathy or osteoporosis and may cause permanent disability in HH patients despite a properly conducted treatment with phlebotomies. In this study, selected parameters of calcium and phosphate metabolism were analyzed in combination with the assessment of bone mineral density (BMD) disorders in patients from northern Poland with clinically overt HFE-HH. BMD was determined by a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) test with the use of the trabecular bone score (TBS) function.</p>

	   					<h4>Low incidence of focal lesions in the thyroid glands  of patients with hereditary haemochromatosis  — a single-centre study from Poland</h4>
	   					<p>Hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) is a disease characterised by the excessive absorption of iron and its deposition in various organs. Late complications of this disease include cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and endocrine disorders. Data from the literature on thyroid disorders in patients with HH are inconsistent and ambiguous, and no research has been done to determine the relationship between excessive accumulation of iron and the thyroid morphology. Therefore, the aim of this study was to characterise thyroid function and ultrasound images in patients with clinically overt hereditary haemochromatosis.</p>

	   					<h4>Dynamic Representations of Biological Sequences</h4>
	   					<p>Methods of bioinformatics in which the biological sequences (DNA, RNA, protein) are represented by sets of material points in 2D, 3D, or 20D space, and described by values analogous to the ones used in the dynamics, as e.g. moments of inertia, are reviewed. A new application of the 3D method, called by us 3D-Dynamic Representation of DNA/RNA Sequences is proposed. It is shown that the method is useful for a description of complete genome sequences of dengue virus.</p>

	   					<h4>An Application of the 2D-Dynamic Representation of DNA/RNA Sequences to the Prediction of Influenza A Virus Subtypes</h4>
	   					<p>A new theoretical method for the virus identifcation has been proposed. The 2D-Dynamic Representation of DNA/RNA Sequences has been applied to the prediction of influenza A virus subtypes. We have shown that the method can be successfully combined with novel supervised machine learning algorithms, such as C5.0. The descriptors of the 2D-Dynamic Representation of DNA/RNA Sequences have been evaluated. High mean accuracy of predicting the subtype of the influenza A virus has been obtained (over 90% of correct predictions). As a consequence, the combination of the machine learning algorithms and the 2D-Dynamic Representation of DNA/RNA Sequences has been shown to constitute a simple and accurate tool for the classifcation of unidentifed virus strains.</p>

	   					<p>2D-dynamic representation of DNA/RNA sequences has been applied for the characterization of the complete genome sequence of Zika virus. Graphically, the 2D-dynamic graphs evolve with time. Numerically, applying descriptors related to the 2D-dynamic graphs, correct classification of the sequences has been obtained. These descriptors have been shown to give an adequate characteristics of the Zika virus genome. The classification diagrams form a new mathematical description of the evolution of the genome sequence of the Zika virus.</p>
